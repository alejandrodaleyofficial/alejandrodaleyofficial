Hi, 👋 I'm Alejandro Daley.

I'm a student pursuing a BSc in Computing at The University of Technology, Jamaica.

- 🌱 I'm currently learning HTML & CSS, with JavaScript and React next on my roadmap as I study front-end development this summer (2025).
- 🔭 I'm looking to collaborate on beginner-friendly projects, front-end applications, and practice projects.
- 📫 How to reach me: alejandrodaleyofficial (Instagram & Telegram).
- ⚡ Fun fact: Despite my name being Spanish, I have no Spanish heritage.
